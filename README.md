Web portal application for YOLO based video surveillance system

## Introduction

This project is a web portal application for a video surveillance system based on YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The system is designed to detect and track objects in real-time video streams from multiple cameras. The system is capable of detecting multiple objects in a single frame and tracking them across multiple frames. The system is also capable of detecting and tracking objects in low-light conditions and in the presence of occlusions.

## Features

The web portal application provides the following features:

1. Real-time video streaming from multiple cameras
2. Object detection and tracking using YOLO algorithm
